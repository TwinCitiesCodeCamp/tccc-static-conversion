But what happens when a large amount of your data is large    enough that it needs to go into the large object heap. How do you make sure that    you are not fragmenting it so much that the next request to get data has space?    How do you make sure that these large pieces of data are not mapped into the address    space all the time, taking up valuable space in the 2GB limit?</p><p>    This presentation will focus on some specific functionality that Thomson-West implemented    to handle large legal documents (MB of XML), that can be slow to retrieve via soap    in a manner that kept them out of the large object heap. Discussion will center    on implementing a soap extension that generically parses a soap response to pull    out the large strings, pushing them to the Virtual Heap, instead of placing them    on the large object heap.</p>",

We've heard about it,    dabbled in it, and might have considered using it in some our solutions… but one    of the hesitations comes from integration. How will it work with existing data?    How will it work with existing .NET applications and libraries? The answers are    out there ... and this discussion will lead you to examples on how you can do integration    (both ways) between Ruby on Rails and .Net. You'll see how you can easily invoke    / publish web services, databases, and libraries between the two. Come check out    what all the hype is about and expand your toolbox to help provide better solutions    to your problems.</p>",

      "Abstract": "From humble beginnings, JavaScript has gone from a hastily thrown together language for web pages to a hastily thrown together language that runs everywhere. If you can do it with code, you can probably do it in JavaScript. It's the Swiss Army Knife of programming languages. \n\nUnfortunately, JavaScript wasn't designed for the large scale apps we use it in today. We've had to rely on design patterns, willpower, and luck to mitigate JavaScript's failings. However, there is a better way. TypeScript adds features to JavaScript that make it usable on large projects. \n\nAdditionally, the bar for web applications gets higher everyday. jQuery was cool ten years ago, but it doesn't cut it for modern web apps. We need something with a little more horsepower. Angular 2 makes it easy to build clean, modular web apps. \n\nIn this talk, we'll explore TypeScript and Angular 2 and how they can be used together to build large-scale web applications. We will learn how to get started and get up to speed quickly.",

We'll see how compilers work with code, and how tests are set up to yield hard facts on performance and memory usage. We'll use this information to make rationale judgements for our coding standards.

      "Abstract": "WebAssembly is a new low-level, high-performance alternative to JavaScript on the Web. As an open standard developed by Mozilla, Google, Microsoft, and Apple, WebAssembly will eventually run everywhere that JavaScript does: in every major Web browser, and in runtimes like Node.js and Electron which are derived from those browsers.\n\nAfter three years of research and experimentation, WebAssembly is finally real. The specification has stabilized, and the first implementation debuted with Firefox 52 on March 7th, and in Chrome shortly thereafter.\n\nThis talk examines WebAssembly from a practical standpoint, answering what it is, why it was created, how it works, and how you can use it today.",

Well look no further than Azure Functions! Yes, you're probably thinking there's already a dozen other ways to host an application that you already know about so why think about another? Azure Functions provide a uniquely flexible platform which allows developers to deploy code in multiple ways using multiple languages while being able to bind directly Azure or HTTP based triggers. If that doesn't sound appealing then at least you could tell everyone you're going serverless, which sounds cool, right? In this session we'll explore scenarios where using Azure Functions could be useful, pros and cons compared to other technologies, and plenty of examples to give you some ideas.",

      "Abstract": "We all agree that performance is important, but in our zeal to be first to market, we don’t realize that performance problems exist until a site is already in production. This talk is intended to arm developers and other technically-inclined professionals with knowledge that will help them be proactive in addressing this difficult problem. In this session, you’ll learn about:\n\n- Evoking genuine concern for performance by helping your colleagues identify your site’s target audience, and identify that audience’s capabilities by using data from Akamai’s State of the Internet connectivity report.\n\n- How to use this newly-acquired information in concert with automated testing tools to approximate what key performance metrics will be for your users.\n\n- Spring into action by automating optimization tasks with Node and gulp, so that you’ll be optimizing as you develop, instead of after the fact.\n\n- Some techniques for achieving quick performance wins for troublesome sites already in production, such as resource hints, PostCSS and more.",

Even equipped with the best possible data, a growing body of research reveals just how deeply flawed our perceptions, thinking, and conclusions are and why.     Be careful not to assume that agile methods alone are the solution.  \n\nWhat is the Solution? Awareness! By exploring the psychology of error we create the opportunity to overcome many of the pitfalls hindering even the best teams.  We reveal a common condition that lowers individual IQ by 13 points! We show why many teams perform far below the level they think they are. We explore the biases, fallacies, and mental pratfalls common to every one of us rendering even the smartest teams dumb. You’ll come away with an understanding of the very real forces that distort our decisions and concrete tips you can use to mitigate the damage, and avoid these traps altogether.",

First, we’ll discuss temporal tables, which provide a convenient way to track all of the changes made to data in a table.  Second, we’ll talk about the JSON support built into SQL Server 2016 and what capabilities it provides us.  Third, we’ll cover some advanced SQL constructs like the MERGE statement and Common Table Expressions that can make the SQL you write simpler.  And finally, we’ll wrap up by talking about the windowing functions in SQL Server, which provide powerful analytic capabilities to our SQL Statements.\n\nAfter this talk, you will better appreciate some of the rich functionality built into SQL Server and understand how to use these capabilities to make your job easier.",

Because unit    testing is so important, it should be easy to perform unit testing. The developer    should be able to focus on the \"what\" the unit tests demonstrates rather than the    \"how\" to demonstrate the result. There are a fairly large number of unit testing    tools that can greatly simplify the unit testing process. Many of these tools are    free. This session would include a \"dash\" of unit testing philosophy plus a lot    of code that demonstrates the use the \"core\" unit testing harnesses such as NUnit,    MbUnit, and MsTest as well as related testing tools such as NUnitForms and NUnitASP.    The session will also address the use of tools to replace dependent elements with    dummy units, stub units, and mock units. The types of units to be tested will include:    Logic, Window Forms, Web Pages, Databases, XML Files, JavaScript, and Ajax functionality.</p>",

In that time    Jon has had the opportunity to make most of the serious software development mistakes    at least once. He has programmed in over a dozen languages including several different    assembly languages, Fortran, COBOL, SNOBOL, classic Visual Basic, VB.NET, and C#.    He has survived the structured programming revolution and the object-oriented revolutions    (having inexplicably missed out on the sexual revolution). Jon's software development    activities have included the development of operating systems, scientific and engineering    applications, and enterprise systems. He has worked in every phase of software development    from the initial specification of requirements through to customer support. Along    the way, he picked up a BS in Mathematics and an MBA. He still has hopes of finding    something that he can be reasonably good at. His long term interests center about    databases and the aspects of the application that handle data access and business    logic. He is also interested in the tools and processes that assist the development    process. Jon can be reached at jons@magenic.com.",

Put your database scripts here, your functional tests here, html markup here,    controller logic here, your unit tests here, and put your model here. To validate    your model, add a few lines here. And because of some simple and reasonable naming    conventions, it all plays well together. Ask a .Net developer how to tackle the    same business problem. She'll start thinking. Well, the UI seems pretty obvious,    but from there it gets difficult. You might start by doing the \"simplest thing that    can possibly work,\" and drag a dataset onto your screen. But where do you put your    database scripts? And how do you test your business logic? Or your UI controller    logic? And how do you name things? If this developer has been around for a while,    she probably has a few favorite patterns in her toolbox. Maybe she's even got some    of the pieces covered with reusable code libraries. But she doesn't have a solid,    well-tested, common framework for completing even a simple business scenario. She    should! In this presentation, we'll describe how Rails removes many of the common    barriers to getting real work done – and discuss how the .Net community might do    the same.</p>",

      "Abstract": "As the user experience becomes more important, real-time push notifications are an important tool for web developers to master. Learn how to build real-time server-to-client and client-to-server push services in ASP.NET using SignalR. SignalR makes it incredibly simple to build communication hubs for real-time notifications, peer-to-peer collaboration, and real-time content delivery. SignalR is flexible, extensible and scalable. We will cover setting up a complete MVC5 application using both the Javascript client API and the .NET client. There are several transport protocols available depending on which server and client platforms you are using. We will discuss these options as well as extending, scaling and customizing SignalR.",

The experiment worked: Programs written in C and compiled to this intermediate language, called asm.js, could deliver runtime performance within 1.5x of their native C speed. In contrast to Google's Native Client (NaCl / PNaCl) projects, asm.js remained backwards compatible with existing JavaScript engines.<br><br>Clearly, there was room for performance improvement on the Web, and a way to get there without breaking old browsers.<br><br>Last year, Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Mozilla formed a W3C Community Group to collaborate \"on a new, portable, size- and load-time-efficient format suitable for compilation to the web.\" They called it WebAssembly, and it starts landing in browsers this year.<br><br>Suddenly, JS isn't the only game in town: programs will be written in C, compiled to WebAssembly, and run faster than JavaScript ever could.

      "Abstract": "In today's world it has become virtually impossible to write software without using open source tools, libraries, or frameworks. Even if you avoid \"third party\" open source components, Microsoft is open sourcing more and more of .NET itself that it is inescapable. So should you be worried? Didn't Steve Ballmer tell us open source was bad and dangerous? Well, there are things you should know about open source in terms of licensing, maintainability, support. Many are things you need to think about when using ANY code you didn't write yourself, whether open source or not. By the end of this session you'll understand where open source does and doesn't differ from traditional proprietary tools, libraries, and frameworks. You might still be worried, but you'll understand WHY you are worried.",

In this session, we will walk through a sample application that leverages TypeScript, Angular2, and ASP.NET MVC/Web API. You will learn how TypeScript can help augment your development experience and your existing knowledge as a Javascript developer by adding type safety, OO concepts, and ES6 features to your codebase. If you consider yourself a C# or .NET developer and do Javascript on the side, TypeScript is a great fit for all the paradigms you're used to. If you work in a Linux or Mac world, you’ll still be able to leverage TypeScript with cross-platform tooling. Come and learn something that might help you become more productive and make your applications more robust and less scary to refactor. The speaker recommends watching his previous TypeScript Demystified talk for a grounding in the concepts of TypeScript but it’s not required.",

      "Abstract": "<p>\tDo you want to learn how to automatically generate strongly-typed Angular services for your Web API? What about Knockout view models that stay synced with your server-side code? In this session, we will walk through a sample application that leverages TypeScript, Angular2, and ASP.NET MVC/Web API. You will learn how TypeScript can help augment your development experience and your existing knowledge as a Javascript developer by adding type safety, OO concepts, and ES6 features to your codebase. If you consider yourself a C# or .NET developer and do Javascript on the side, TypeScript is a great fit for all the paradigms you're used to. If you work in a Linux or Mac world, you’ll still be able to leverage TypeScript with cross-platform tooling. Come and learn something that might help you become more productive and make your applications more robust and less scary to refactor. The speaker recommends watching his previous <a href=\"https://github.com/kamranayub/presentations/tree/master/demystifying-typescript\" target=\"_blank\">TypeScript Demystified</a> talk for a grounding in the concepts of TypeScript but it’s not required.</p>",

With this radically new approach comes a pattern to replace the common paradigm of two-way data-binding MV* frameworks. This pattern is known as \"Flux.\" While React has been gaining steam for a couple of years now, the Flux pattern is still a relative mystery to most of us.</p><p>\tIn this talk, we'll start with a quick recap of React to get everybody up to speed. Then we'll dive into the nuts and bolts of the Flux pattern, investigate some of the more popular Flux frameworks and make sure you walk away fully understanding this enigma.</p>",

Most of us have used Apple's Siri, Google Now, Microsoft's Cortana, or Amazon's Alexa - but how can you speak with your web application?  The Web Speech API can enable a voice interface by adding both Speech Synthesis (Text to Speech) and Speech Recognition (Speech to Text) functionality.</p><p>\tThis session will introduce the core concepts of Speech Synthesis and Speech Recognition.  We will evaluate the current browser support and review alternative options.  See the JavaScript code and UX design considerations required to add a speech interface to your web application.

      "Abstract": "<p>\tThree years ago, Mozilla began experimenting with a low-level subset of JavaScript that supported ahead-of-time compilation and eliminated garbage collection pauses. The experiment worked: Programs written in C and compiled to this intermediate language, called asm.js, could deliver runtime performance within 1.5x of their native C speed. In contrast to Google's Native Client (NaCl / PNaCl) projects, asm.js remained backwards compatible with existing JavaScript engines.</p><p>\tClearly, there was room for performance improvement on the Web, and a way to get there without breaking old browsers.</p><p>\tLast year, Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Mozilla formed a W3C Community Group to collaborate \"on a new, portable, size- and load-time-efficient format suitable for compilation to the web.\" They called it WebAssembly, and it starts landing in browsers this year.</p><p>\tSuddenly, JS isn't the only game in town: programs will be written in C, compiled to WebAssembly, and run faster than JavaScript ever could. Is this the end? Do we all have to learn C? Come to the talk and find out!</p>",

Creating a few cards in graphics software like Inkscape is one thing, but what about 50 or 100 cards? What happens when you need to update them all? That’s the value of generating your SVG using JavaScript.</p><p>    We will start with a blank screen, adding color and graphics elements like lines, shapes, text and images. Learn about container elements and defining content for re-use. Understand how units in the SVG coordinate system can transform our on-screen creation into an 8.5 by 11 inch printed page (or PDF). SVG examples will be both in their native XML format and created from JavaScript using Snap.svg, an open source library from Adobe designed for modern web browsers.</p><p>    You will leave this session with a basic knowledge of SVG concepts, how to programmatically generate SVG using JavaScript, and how to make your SVG creation printer friendly.</p>",

One of those problems is having an entirely separate team of developers with an entirely separate skillset for each platform on which you’d like your app to work. Cross-platform mobile development seeks to alleviate this problem.</p><p>    In this talk, we’ll take a deep-dive into the Xamarin framework. We’ll take an in-depth look at the Xamarin approach to solving this problem, as well as briefly touch upon native development and other technologies’ cross-platform solutions and when each one may be appropriate to use. We’ll also go over some best practices for Xamarin development for the enterprise environment and take a look at tools associated with Xamarin.</p>",

They don't notice how often they mutter \"..how'd he implement that..\" or \"..where's that method that does X?\"  They don't notice that the search tool they use to answer these questions is from the 1960s. They don't even seem to notice that 90% of these type of searches fail! Fortunately, a developer turned researcher did notice, and has dedicated the better part of the last decade to eliminating this quiet productivity-killer.</p><p>    In this talk, I'll use both video examples and a massive repository of real developer activity data to prove that the typically-used regex searches waste a significant part of your day.  Yet this talk won't dwell on the past; it focuses squarely on a better search future. I'll provide a tour of Visual Studio's many built in searches, demonstrate two search tools available as extensions, and provide guidelines for better searching. By attending this talk you will become a more effective searcher, a skill that is surprisingly fundamental to software development, and I estimate you can eliminate 10-30% waste from an average sprint.</p>",

If you're comfortable in another language like JavaScript, Python, Ruby, C#, or Java you'll be fine. Even if you aren't quite comfortable, you should still be able to follow along and maybe you'll even be at an advantage, not having to ignore all you know about imperative programming!</p>",

Are there reasonable ways of cutting costs when developing tablet apps? How much visual design and code reuse is there in “universal” apps that run on phones and tablets? How different is a tablet from a laptop, and how different is it from a phone? All this and more will be discussed as we cover one of the leading trends for mobility in 2014.</p>",

After a high level overview of SQL Server isolation levels, we’ll spend the majority of this session discussing the implementation of optimistic concurrency control within SQL Server. We’ll look at the benefits and drawbacks of using an optimistic isolation level and discuss use cases where it may or may not be appropriate.

Unlike native languages, it offers a byte-code which can be JITted    to high-performance native code at runtime, and offers near-native speeds on various    platforms such as Windows Phone, Windows 98-Windows 7, Windows 8, and Linux. Although    the same byte-code can be run on all platforms, the difficulty is often finding    libraries that will work on all these platforms, without the need to re-write your    code for each one. In this session, I will be introducing a cross-platform library,    which works seamlessly across all these platforms, and can be used to write high-performance    games, and other 3D applications for all the platforms above. This project is currently    available as an open-source library on <a href=\"https://github.com/IDWMaster/3DAPI\" target=\"_blank\">Github</a>, and anyone is welcome to contribute to it.</p>",

In this presentation, Kurt Christensen will explain    what macros are and why you might want to create them, along with some tips and    tricks for writing and debugging Clojure macros.</p>",

This session will help you wade through the staggering number of development options    available and give you the info needed to make the right decisions for your Client,    Product or Organization. We'll start with an overview of the Mobile ecosystem and    the basic concepts of the Cocoa Touch framework. From there we'll dig into MonoTouch    and show the power and flexibility it provides over native Objective-C development.    We'll also give a tour of some time saving libraries like MonoTouch.Dialog that,    well, just make our lives easier.</p>",

      "Title": "ORM – Not Just for Meditation Any More",
      "Abstract": "<p>    The \"shape\" of data in a relational database is not the same as the \"shape\" of data    in an object oriented application. That is as it should be; for both efficiency    and effectiveness, the goals for storing data are different from those of manipulating    it within the application. The question is how to bridge the inevitable gap between    the two environments. For an increasing number of projects, an Object Relational    Mapping (ORM) package is the answer. An ORM allows the developer (1) to declaratively    define a conceptual model of how the application wants to see the data, (2) to point    to an existing data store (e.g., a database), and (3) to define a mapping between    the conceptual and physical data. From this declarative model, the ORM generates    the code to move data back and forth between the application's view of the data    and the data store's view of the data. We will write several versions of a simple    (yet compelling) application using the new Entity Framework ORM package from Microsoft,    using NHiberate from the open source world, and using LLBGenPro from the non-Microsoft    commercial world. Comparing and contracting will take place. Look for a few \"Top    Ten\" lists about ORM: features to look for, reasons to use ORM, functionality other    than data mapping that ORM provides, and ORM practices to avoid.</p><p>Presentation Material</p><ul>    <li><a href=\"http://blog.magenic.com/blogs/jons/archive/2008/04/28/2008-Spring-Code-Camp.aspx\">Code Drop</a></li>    <li><a href=\"http://blog.magenic.com/blogs/jons/archive/2008/04/28/The-PowerPoint-Deck-for-the-ORM-Talk.aspx\">Slide Deck</a></li></ul>",

He has programmed in over a dozen languages including several different assembly    languages, Fortran, COBOL, SNOBOL, classic Visual Basic, VB.NET, and C#. He has    survived the structured programming revolution and the object-oriented revolutions    (having inexplicably missed out on the sexual revolution). Jon's software development    activities have included the development of operating systems, scientific and engineering    applications, and enterprise systems. He has worked in every phase of software development    from the initial specification of requirements through to customer support. Along    the way, he picked up a BS in Mathematics and an MBA. He still has hopes of finding    something that he can be reasonably good at.

Working with so many different agile teams simultaneously has been a very enlightening experience. Most of the usual battles new agile teams face have been fought and won, and new and interesting challenges arise. Come to this session to learn how 30 team, with over 300 repos, all work together on the same product and release functionality independently of each other.</p>",

      "Abstract": "<p>    Most developers want to be able to write better code in less time which is why tools like ReSharper are so popular. If you've been keeping up on the latest from the Microsoft developer front you've probably heard about the .NET Compiler Platform (\"Roslyn\"). Beyond having visibility into the inner workings of the compiler one of the main features is the set of code analysis APIs it provides. In this session we'll walk through using those APIs to create your own ReSharper-like code refactorings and code fixes using the latest CTP of Visual Studio 2015. With any luck you'll leave with some ideas on how you can use the .NET Compiler Platform to scratch a couple items off your own personal \"I wish Visual Studio did this\" list.</p>",

I'll also demonstrate using common C-style FFI mechanisms to call into functions written in Rust from other programming languages, like Python, Ruby, or Node.js.</p><p>    Rust is already being used in nontrivial, real-world projects.

But these hacks are just to work around the limitations of an aging protocol. Although HTTP/1.1 has served the world fairly well for the past 15 years, changes to the way in which we use the Internet have pushed this protocol beyond what it was designed to do. The HTTP/2 specification addresses many of these limitations, while also making better use of network resources. Topics to be discussed are HPACK header compression, multiplexing, server push, and security considerations. Basic knowledge of TCP and HTTP/1.1 is recommended.</p>",

It is too hard to create meaningful logs for complex distributed systems when we are stuck using old logging frameworks. The Serilog library for the .NET framework and its structured or semantic logs allow us to add more context to our logs, more easily correlate logs across systems and greatly ease our querying and exploration of errors based on events in the system and other log entries. Serilog is easy to integrate into existing applications and can help you provide the rich data that you are looking for at development time in and in production by abstracting your logging sinks away from how you create your messages. It has a clean and simple API and a healthy ecosystem of sinks for your application to log to so you'll still be able to meet your companies standards and help improve upon them. Let your logs make you happy for once.</p>",

Rather than being general purpose programming languages, they focus solely on the task of developing for the web. These languages use DSLs to simplify the common tasks of writing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and interacting with the database. Also differing from many dynamic language web stacks, these languages employ static type systems which can catch many common errors early in the development cycle; saving on a lot of debugging time.</p><p>    The frameworks that I'll cover are: Opa, Ur/Web, and Elm. The talk will also cover some functional programming techniques that are in common use in the frameworks.</p><p>    I'll present several reasons why I think that web development is tending towards these sorts of technologies. Even if you don't find yourself using one of these in particular, you may well end up using the concepts that they contain.</p>",

Windows Forms is out and \"Modern UI\" (Formerly    \"Metro\") is in. During this session we'll start by designing our database schema    in SQL Server. Next, we'll expose our data via an HTTP API using Web API. Then we'll    tie it all together by writing a Windows 8 Modern UI-style application that consumes    our data and makes it available to the user. If we want to finish we'll need to    do away with the pleasantries and write code right out of the gate.</p>",

Then three are    games themselves, grandmas and toddlers are playing massively multi-player online    games. Games are huge parts of our lives, even if we don’t realize it. In this session    we will explore how game theory drives behavior. What are key gaming concepts that    we can leverage in our applications? How do we satisfy different gamer demographics    when building actual games? The games industry is in a huge shift of both decline    and growth. Where is gaming going? This session will strive to create a greater    appreciation for the complexity of game theory and the behavior it drives.</p>",

In this talk, you'll learn to use    CoffeeScript and the Jasmine testing library to develop solid, testable client-side    code. We'll cover how to create encapsulated code, how to stub out remote calls,    and how to automate the test suite so it can run automatically in the background    or as part of a continuous integration server. If you write client side code but    need to know how to test it, this talk is for you.</p>",

When professionals    talk about usability, it’s hard not to think of people similar to themselves - but    what if your customers are not \"typical\" web users? How do you build for them or    discover how they interact with your site? In this talk Keith and Tim share their    real-world experience managing <a href=\"http://www.jpcycles.com\" target=\"_blank\">jpcycles.com</a>    (one of the world's 500 largest retail websites) and how they are working to identify    their customers' needs and adjusting their site to make it more friendly to their    motorcycle riding customers. Tim and Keith will share openly and honestly about    the tools they are using daily to maximize the experience and uncover \"truth\" in    their customers. Interestingly great website design is much aligned with the Hells    Angels motto: \"When we do right, nobody remembers. When we do wrong, nobody forgets.\"</p>",

Heavy on code samples, best practices, anti    patterns, gotchyas, and random insights, this presentation is meant to serve as    a reference point for creating a beautiful Backbone implementation for apps of any    size and reduce the learning curve of BackboneJS.

I’m not going to pretend that there aren’t    lots of frameworks out there to get the job done but something about Durandal.js    feels different – it’s simple, it runs on Knockout.js for MVVM goodness and importantly    you don’t have to write much code! FluentKnockoutHelpers builds on the power of    Knockout by using .NET and the Razor view engine to create ‘ASP.NET MVC like’ statically    typed helpers for use with Knockout. Utilize static typing, intellisense and the    compiler you already have in .NET to make Knockout development easier! In this presentation    expect to learn some pros and cons of SPAs including reasons to create a SPA in    the first place. After that we’ll dive right into the code of a non-trivial SPA    utilizing Durandal.js, Knockout.js, Require.js, Razor and WebAPI.</p>",

Writing the documentation    before writing the code, can lead to better code, better implementation and, of    course, actual documentation. This talk isn't just about philosophy. It covers actual    experiences and contains practical tips and solutions to get started. Discover how    easy it is to write down your ideas and iteratively develop the documentation. Learn    some of the tools to use to make your documentation look great. Find out that writing    things down doesn't have to be a chore, but can be liberating, and helpful when    working with non-technical people.</p>",

The Google Play store has the largest install    base, and iOS undoubtedly generates the most revenues. But for developers looking    for a new opportunity, can the Windows 8 store offer opportunities the established    players can't? During this talk, we will demonstrate how it's still early days in    the Windows 8 store, and now is the time to get your app in the store and capitalize    on this new and growing market. We will cover what we have seen by having a top    10 app, a top 100 app, and a low-tier app in the store at the same time. During    the second portion of our talk, we will do a 'deep dive' and look at analytics of    user behavior inside mobile applications, what metrics drive revenues, and how you    can capture metrics in your app (whether on Windows, Android or iOS) to increase    your revenues too.</p>",

If the answer is    yes, perhaps you should be taking a look at Groovy. It sort of looks like Java,    acts like Java, and under the covers really is Java (i.e. it compiles to byte code)    so one could say it acts like a duck, talks like a duck, and therefore must be a    duck. So, what exactly is that duck? It is a language that - supports closures for    functional programming - can be either dynamically or statically typed (depending    on the preferences of the programmer or the context of the code) - has built in    mocking, which achieves great power through closures, while at the same time - looks    like and plays well with Java - interoperates with Spring - is understood by IntelliJ    Interested, come and chat about real life experiences of Groovy into Java code bases.</p>",

Can a user speak with a sales person in    their browser if they have a question about a product on your web site? These are    just a few opportunities, beyond the LCD or touch screen, that you might be missing    to interface with your users. There are approximately 7 billion users on the global    telecom network. That's over twice as many as computers and smart phones combined.    Creating rich voice and SMS interfaces will allow you to reach more people and serve    your existing customers better than ever before. Twilio makes creating these \"no-screen\"    user interfaces incredibly easy. If you've created a web page before, you've already    got what it takes to create a phone or SMS interface with Twilio. In this session,    we will explore how and where to add telephony into an existing application using    the Twilio platform. After a high-level overview of Twilio, we will live code new    voice and SMS features into an existing web application. We'll demonstrate how developers    can receive and respond to text messages and voice calls, and how developers can    reach out to any of the ~7 billion users on the global telecom network at any time.    Finally, we will demonstrate how developers can turn any web browser, iDevice, or    Android device with a network connection into a VoIP telephone using Twilio Client.    Code examples will be primarily JavaScript and Ruby, but the core concepts will    be applicable to any server-side programming environment. No previous experience    with telecom or a particular web development framework will be assumed. Voice and    SMS are the next frontier of usability, and Twilio can help you blaze the trail.</p>",

Written using Vala, the Ambition framework allows a developer or    team of developers to create web applications or RESTful services using a static-typed    object oriented language without relying on a VM or a garbage collection cycle.    Plus, being compiled, it allows cloud deployment to be easy and inexpensive, as    memory and CPU requirements can be a fraction of PHP, Ruby, Python, or Perl sites.    While it's not \"officially\" released, it's available on GitHub, and being actively    developed. Patches, help, and end users are very welcome, and I'd like to show you    more.</p>",

Unfortunately the MVC is not a one-size-fits-all    pattern and it tends to point developers away from proper object-oriented design.    We'll talk about how to organize code beyond the MVC, decoupling application logic    from the MVC, and when it's best to use a Service Layer instead of Models. While    the talk will mostly focus on Rails, we'll be discussing established object-oriented    programming principles and these ideas should be applicable to anyone working with    an MVC-based framework.</p>",

This means that native UIKit applications,    games, and everything in between can now be written in JavaScript, without the addition    of a third party framework or missing out on rich platform APIs. After many years    in purgatory, JavaScript is now blessed and officially supported by Apple for usage    in native iOS apps. In this talk, we'll focus on what developers need to know to    take advantage of JavaScriptCore bindings in iOS 7. We will also explore where this    new technology fits in alongside existing JavaScript solutions for mobile development,    like Appcelerator's Titanium and Apache Cordova (PhoneGap). To demonstrate how this    new framework might be used, we will script a simple game using SpriteKit, the new    built-in 2D game framework in iOS 7. There are many exciting possible applications    of this technology, and I hope the JavaScript community takes full advantage of    them.</p>",

How do you leverage MVVM, add offline capability, cache data, handle    logging &amp; exceptions, and polish it for a great user experience? We’ll take an existing    basic application (mine, in fact) and enhance it while I share tips, tricks, and    gotchas related to building a fully realized Windows Phone app that will help you    level up your existing application and learn what it takes to build a real live    app.</p>",

In this session we take a look at the secure development approach and go thru the top exploits that you need to know about. We'll show how you can use .NET features to stop exploits before they happen. You don’t want to be at the center of the next media frenzy over lost data and compromised records, or lose your customers confidence and trust in how you do business.  From injection attacks and cross site scripting to security misconfiguration we look at the hacker's psyche and show how they think and work, and learn what we can do to build more secure software.</p>",

Many people still see the public cloud as prohibitively expensive; particularly if they are used to large on-premise servers with very fast processors and high quantities of memory per server. However; on Azure, it is more economical to \"scale out\" rather than \"scale up\". In this speech, I will discuss techniques for developing a highly scalable app for the Azure cloud, as well as minimizing the cost of hosting while maximizing performance.</p>",

      "Abstract": "<p>    RESTful approaches for exposing data via HTTP have become very popular over the last 5 years, but it turns out we aren’t done with this yet. The original paper by Roy Fielding that coined the phrase was actually talking about something quite different than what we think of REST being today. His idea’s focus was the messages (media types) used to transition from one state to another in a process oriented design using a small number of “verbs”. This is quite different from the entity oriented designs where the client holds the knowledge of the overall process that we have grown used to. At the center of the style is a state machine that is used to tell the client what it’s possible next steps are which it does with every response. Come and explore what a hypermedia design looks like from both the client (Wordpress plugin or javascript) and server’s (in c#) perspective with an application written on the Hypertext Application Language (HAL).</p><ul>    <li>What do mean only one starting url?</li>    <li>Hey you changed the url of my kittens link, what the heck!</li>    <li>So I can just ignore that rel and profile stuff, ok?</li>    <li>A resource, so you just mean my database, right?</li>    <li>A media type is like my mp3’s, right?</li>    <li>I love version numbers, so where do they go?</li>    <li>How do know when I can update my kitten photo and when I can’t?</li>    <li>No hacker will try to use this I am pretty sure.</li></ul>",

So we were left wondering, when will we be able to write software for the next version of this awesome sensor?!   I am currently on the early preview program for the Kinect HD for Windows.   The Kinect HD for Windows was officially released to the public on July 15th.   However they haven’t released all the features of the SDK to the public yet.  I am proud and excited to show you the great new features that come with the Kinect HD sensor.</p><p>    Besides being a full HD (1920x1080) sensor, it also allows you to track up to six people simultaneously.   Body tracking has greater detail and more points to work with.   The sensor is less susceptible to ambient lighting.   The overall programming interface has been updated to be much more efficient.   Audio filtering has been greatly enhanced to minimize noise.   You can even use the Kinect HD sensor for Windows Store Apps.</p><p>    There are many exciting possibilities for the Kinect HD sensor.  I hope you will join me as I show you what it can do for you.</p>",

We'll spend a little time on XDCR, for replicating to other data centers, or to ElasticSearch. We will then create and walk through an example client application for Couchbase, written in JavaScript, and showing a mirror application in C#.</p>",

From hosting with Katana or Helios to new frameworks and middleware free from the legacy of System.Web, the future of .NET web development will look much different from its past. This session will give a brief overview of OWIN and the current landscape, discuss its implications for .NET web application design, and review a real-world example of OWIN in action.</p>",

The PBKDF2 algorithm is used for the deriveKey operation, with getRandomValues generating a cryptographically random salt.

If you feel like you are poking a stick blindly into a house of cards when you do, this session is for you. Web design has come a long way since styles were inline and dispersed throughout the markup. Browser support of CSS3 is better, preprocessors have become ubiquitous, and tables are blasphemous. If you haven't been immersed, it's easy to feel lost. This session aims to give you a solid understanding of modern CSS development.</p><p>    We will review how preprocessors make life easier. We'll differentiate between SASS, Stylus, and LESS and take a look at the Compass framework and libraries like Bourbon. We'll quickly touch responsive design, some of the best parts of CSS3, and testing. The retrospective portion of the talk will involve looking at patterns I've used and encountered. We'll call out the good, bad and ugly to find anti-patterns and appropriate use of what is working. SAAS and lean proof-of-concepts require different strategies, but both should have styles that are scalable and maintainable. We'll define the tools and patterns that can make this possible. You won't be a ninja, but you will be able to include considerations of this important piece of your app's UI when architecting it and help guide practices that will result in better deployments and coverage.</p>",

We will take a look at a representative    set of view engines (ASP.NET, Spark, and NHAML in some detail) and a quick \"fly    by\" of other (NVelocity and Brail). We will look at the good and bad of the coding    experience, the debugging experience, and the (dreaded) maintenance experience.    All of this will be useful input to the selection of a view engine for your next    project.</p><p>    The secret is that the selection does not have to be exclusive. Fun Fact: you can    use multiple view engines in the same application. Funner (OK, Even More Fun) Fact:    you can even use multiple view engines on the same web page. Come and see how to    make the magic happen. More goodies: see how to write your own view engine for fun    and profit; if I told you how easy it was, you might think it was a scam.</p><p>    But wait! there is more: in our \"Bait and Switch\" department, you can see how to    switch the view that you that you use in order to support mobile browsers. You can    even switch view engines on the fly. Learn how to log data for a subset of web pages    (determined by values in your application configuration file) by using a different    View Engine. Bring up your mastery of this dynamite technique at your next social    gathering and see how many admiring glances you get.</p><p>    And there will be unit testing.

      "Abstract": "<p>    Microsoft has embraced the popular jQuery open source JavaScript library, which    is already used by many major web sites. jQuery provides a very productive enivornment    for client side programming in JavaScript. It takes advantage of existing knowledge    of CSS selector syntax to offer a powerful and efficient alternative to the DOM.    The use of operation chaining and implicit iteration lead to a very compact and    productive syntax. The library is very lean at a mere 15K, yet provides a strong    base and a great extensibility model which has led to a large number of plugin extensions    to simplify web development. The session will review how to use the library for    very useful features such as watermarks, avoiding browser inconsistencies, and making    AJAX calls to the server. Several plug ins will be demonstrated which provide stunning    client experiences with as little as 1 line of code! We will also study how to extend    the library with our own custom utility funcitons and plug ins. Learn how Jquery    and the Microsoft AJAX Library JavaScript libraries greatly simplify client side    development, and which to use for particular scenarios.</p>",

Well it does, and you    should learn to use it so you can stop writing repetitive code (i.e. DTO's and DAL's)    and generate it. Come to this session to learn about the Text Template Transformation    Toolkit (T4). T4 allows you to use simple ASP.NET-like template syntax to generate    application source code, configuration files, stored procedures and more. This session    will give you all the information you need to start using T4 effectively in your    project, TODAY! We will go from basics (such as T4 template syntax) to advanced    topics (such as template design and use of T4 in large projects) stopping along    the way to create several templates from scratch.</p><p>    This will be a PowerPoint free presentation. No slides, just code!</p>",

HLSL allows graphics programmers to create realistic graphics through the    use of a combination of math algorithms and the hardware they are processed on.    Around the time of DirectX 8, shaders were implemented to allow changes per geometric    shape, vertex, and pixel during a frame render. As one of the items comes to render    on the graphics device, the math algorithm written into the shader file is applied    to the respective object and is rendered to the screen. Current technology has reached    the point where shaders are a necessity for any graphics developer, considering    graphics libraries such as Microsoft's XNA have removed support for a non-programmed,    ‘fixed' graphics pipeline. A simple shader is built to emulate a point light while    each step includes reasoning behind the code and relevance to the theory of a point    light. A conclusion is given explaining other uses for shaders.</p>",

This means that rendering controls on the client side is much more feasible    and efficient. We're going to leverage functionality and components from two different    JavaScript libraries (jQuery and YUI), to make our ASP.NET MVC websites more expressive    and functional.</p><p>    Most of the techniques used in this talk with YUI and jQuery could be used in Webforms    development with a little modification.</p>",

This continuing change cannot    happen if the software design and implementation is riddled with dependencies: A    change to module A triggers changes in B and C, that collectively, trigger more    changes in D, E, F, and G and so on until the software explodes. This sounds like    a terrific special-effects movie but a very bad information technology experience.    There are design practices that build \"fire walls\" that isolate one part of the    software from other parts, but ultimately the question becomes, how can one part    of the software invoke the services of another part without becoming dependent on    that other part? This sounds very much like a Zen riddle: \"What is the sound of    one hand clapping?\"</p><p>    Enter the twin concepts of Inversion of Control and Dependency Injection. With Inversion    of Control, when a particular module of the software is dependent upon a particular    service, say logging, that dependency is abstracted down to an interface. Any invocation    of the logging function is made against the interface. Before the module can execute,    it must obtain a reference to an object that implements the interface. There are    a lot of ways to accomplish this: 1) passing the reference as a part of instantiating    or invoking the functions of the module, 2) returning the reference from a factory    method, and 3) injecting the dependency reference as part of a Dependency Injection    framework.</p><p>    We will look the design patterns for Inversion of Control and demonstrate code that    uses the following Dependency Injection frameworks:</p><ul>    <li>Castle Windsor</li>    <li>StructureMap</li>    <li>Unity</li>    <li>Spring.NET</li></ul>",

The \"real world\" is chaotic. When we develop software, we abstract from    this messy maelstrom to build database tables and software objects that are, at    least relatively, more structured. But it is impossible to eliminate the mess. Anyone    who writes that part of the application that accepts data at the \"edge\" of the application    knows just how messy it can be. There are three ways that the application design    can respond to the data entry problem:</p><ul>    <li>        Reduce the complexity of the data entry by requiring the user to parse the data        into individual textboxes that are so simple as to be un-interesting. If you build        applications this way, turn your head away in shame. Stand tall and say, \"I will        not make my users do work that the computer software can and should be doing.\"    </li>    <li>        Build logic to parse the mess and extract as much of the meaning from the maelstrom.        This is fun, interesting, and useful. There are several ways of doing this and each        way leads to lots of opportunities to show you some code.    </li>    <li>        Add structure under the covers by using \"micro formats\". Again, this is a good        thing that lends itself to more opportunities to show you some code.    </li></ul><p>    Just so you won't think parsing and micro formats are only for the \"fancy folk\",    we will look at parsing and micro formats to deal with common data entry items such    as addresses and phone numbers. These \"ordinary data entry problems\" can be very    difficult to solve in the general case. We will parse these items with regular expressions,    programmatic state machines, and formal parsers, noting the wonders and woes of    each approach. Once you have struggled with handing the entry of these items, you    should be motivated to make it easier for others by tagging your output using \"micro    formats\" that vastly reduce the effort for other programs to accept the output your    applications produce.</p>",

In this session I'll discuss    design patterns such as Model View Controller (MVC) and Model View Presenter (MVP)    for building presentation layers that can truly be used across multiple platforms,    including WPF, Silverlight and Windows Mobile, and in Software as a Service (SaaS)    scenarios.</p>",

You can use it to check on the status of your servers or    as a frontend to pushing code into production. In this session, you'll learn about    the Shoes framework and see how easy it is to build something fun and useful.</p>",

      "Abstract": "<p>    Software testing has gained a lot of interest in the recent past. Similarly, determining    system capabilities has been something people increasingly care about. But how do    you truly know what your system's capabilities are? How do you know for instance,    that the result of a stress test are not just a fluke or isolated incident? How    can you make accurate and responsible predictions about scalability? A few mathematical    techniques collectively known as Statistical Process control can provide an excellent    mechanism for measuring system performance and resource usage. It provides a solid    theoretical framework so there's no more \"Seems to me like it should do ______\"    or \"Well, to me it looks right...\" Statistical Process control was the driving force    behind Toyota, Nissan and Honda's successes, as well as Sony, Nakamichi and many    other brands known for their quality. And it can be applied to virtually every aspect    of software. To use it, you need a pencil, piece of paper and a calculator, although    a copy of Excel makes it really simple. No expensive tools needed and no heavy learnign    curve.</p>",

Writing your own code generation templates is coding,    pure and simple (well perhaps not so simple). I am going to show you how to code    templates using XML/XSLT, CodeSmith, MyGeneration, and (maybe) Orcas Software Factories.    This will include a lot of code from templates that I have written (will write)    for generating CSLA applications. One of the problems in generating code is how    to extend the generated functionality. No matter how cleverly you code the code    generation templates, there will always be some functionality that makes more sense    to generate by hand. I will take a look at three different approaches to how to    add that functionality to the generated code: using partial classes, using inheritance,    and using delegates. Unit testing is one very important factor in wanting to extend    to extend the generated code. I will cover some ways to structure the code, generated    and hand-crafted, to support unit testing.</p>",

We've heard how it can be used to easily access data    from a variety of sources like custom objects, SQL Server, web services, and XML.    This session focuses on how to use LINQ to quickly and intuitively query XML data.    We'll take a look at the new XML object model in the System.Xml.Linq namespace (XDocument,    XElement, etc.) and how it supports LINQ to XML. While most of our time will be    spent in C#, we will also examine the new \"XML literals\" language feature in VB.NET    and how it makes coding LINQ to XML even easier.</p>",

A lot of the computing    technology that we use is an attempt to hide the chaos of mouse and keyboard events,    messages, and other asynchronous events from our programs. The approaches used to    date have limited succeeded in part by limiting what can be done with parallel processes.    The Reactive Extensions in .NET allow the program logic to handle external events    as first class citizens. Programs can manipulate events using LINQ expressions.</p><p>    Take the example of example of handling a drag-and-drop operation from a source    region of the screen to target region. Without the Reactive Extension logic, this    might take dozens of lines of code to keep track of the state of operation and to    invoke the drop logic at the right time. With Reactive Extensions, you could handle    this in as little as one line of code.</p><p>    The Reactive Extensions are more than a shorthand for multiple lines of code; they    are a different mindset. They provide a way to \"collect\" events and route them to    the appropriate logic in a very simple way. The final bonus is that the Reactive    Extensions provide a way to de-couple the event source from the event consumer in    such a way that unit testing event handling is very simple and understandable.</p>",

He has programmed in over a    dozen languages including several different assembly languages, Fortran, COBOL,    SNOBOL, classic Visual Basic, VB.NET, and C#.

He has worked in every phase of software development from the initial specification    of requirements through to customer support. Along the way, he picked up a BS in    Mathematics and an MBA. He still has hopes of finding something that he can be reasonably    good at.

But, the inertia of the couch is sometimes just too much to    overcome. We've got the skill and the ideas, but sometimes we just need a kick.    One terrific kick is Startup Weekend (Nov 19-21, go sign up ,we'll wait). In this    session Andy Pickett describes how Startup Weekend provided that launch pad and    just enough boost for his teammates to get something real off the ground. That something    is QONQR, the GeoSocial Game of World Domination! This session will be 1 part code,    1 part business, 1 part game theory, and 100% awesome. We'll walk through the process    of the startup from pitch to design to alpha to beta and beyond. It will include    a tour through the (3 week old) codebase that is QONQR (including a Mobile Web front    end using ASP.Net MVC 2 and jQuery, a Tactical Command Center written in Silverlight,    and SQL Server back end). Hopefully this will just be a fun, maybe inspiring conversation    about getting something started. There will be absolutely no best practices or patterns    displayed, as well as no legally binding business advice of any kind, this much    we promise you.</p>",

      "Abstract": "<p>    To successfully create a ubiquitous data access technology that can work with any    data source, Microsoft needed to build a framework that anyone can work with to    introduce their own providers. This ubiquitous data access technology is called    Language Integrated Query (LINQ). Today, Microsoft ships several LINQ providers    out-of-the-box: LINQ to Objects, LINQ to DataSet, LINQ to SQL, LINQ to Entities,    LINQ to XML, and LINQ to Data Services. There are also many 3rd party LINQ providers    for various data sources, made possible by reusable .NET Framework types. LINQ to    Twitter is one such 3rd party provider, which is the example used in this presentation.    You'll learn how LINQ to Twitter is implemented with various interfaces and patterns    to expose the common LINQ development experience you've grown accustomed to with    other providers. The main difference is that the data source is Twitter. Since LINQ    to Twitter is open source, you also have a working example and will gain insight    into how to create your own LINQ provider, should you ever have a need to do so.    Additionally, by looking inside of the process used to build a LINQ provider, you'll    gain a deeper understanding of how LINQ works across all providers.</p>",

      "Abstract": "<p>    If your first thought when deciding to build a web application with Ruby is to run    \"rails APPNAME\", I'm here to tell you: You're doing it all wrong. Ok, that was a    bit harsh. But you needed to hear it. Q: Has Ruby on Rails transformed the way we    think about building web applications? A: Yes. Q: But isn't it true that using Rails    is extremely simple to use even if I haven't done Ruby before? A: Yes. Q: So Rails    is what I should you use build Ruby web applications? A: Maybe. If Rails is a hammer,    it's my goal to show you that your next project may not need nails. I hope to show    you the benefits of how using simple Ruby can put you on the path to better application    design. I'll also show you a few tools of the Rubyist's trade that enable you to    build a modular web application from emerging needs of your problem space. In the    end we'll come full circle and I'll show you how the Rails philosophy is shifting    in the direction of modular design and how we can leverage all of our knowledge    with Rails to build powerful Ruby applications for the web.</p>",

I've been picking up learning    about \"mobile\" development and what it means to business and technologist in my    limited time, juggling multiple projects. The first thing you are faced, when you    want to explore mobile development, is what platform do you want to target? Apple/IOS,    Android, Blackberry, WebOS. As a systems integrator, with a number of technologies    under my belt, the question was how to you reach more than one platform. What I    discovered, is the web based frameworks and html5 are starting to emerge. Yes, these    frameworks are still a little on the bleeding edge of things, but isn't that what    all the fun is about? Get a peek into some of the emerging frameworks in this area.    These frameworks include jQuery Mobile, Sencha, Titanium, SproutCore, PhoneGap,    Rhodes are a few of the leading/bleeding frameworks that let you target multiple    platforms. This won't be a deep dive, but will be a mid-level overview of some of    these frameworks and my journey.</p>",

In actuality, WCF is a framework designed to help you    develop robust service oriented applications and systems. Many developers find themselves    suddenly tasked with building a system using WCF and can become overwhelmed with    the scope of the WCF Framework. Fortunately, WCF is easily embraced when theres    an overall understanding of how the capabilities are organized. In this presentation    we'll first cover the capabilities of WCF and how they align to currently well known    integration strategies. Next, we'll consider some common challenges you'll encounter    when developing enterprise applications and systems with WCF. Lastly, we'll learn    a few of the common scenarios you'll find yourself working with in the real world.</p>",

In this session we'll talk about    how to develop Kinect-based apps for Windows 7 with managed .NET code. The session    will cover the foundations of what you need to build Kinect apps such as drivers,    libraries, detecting and focusing on a user, hand tracking, and simple gestures    such as swiping and pushing. We'll also get in to applying these concepts to Windows    technologies such as WPF and show live examples of Kinect being used in real apps    for real-world scenarios.</p>",

Unfortunately, few of these devices are capable of integrating or providing    a useful assessment of the measurements. We will demonstrate how to quickly capture    data from Bluetooth-enabled devices such as the Wii Balance Board, Zephyr Bioharness,    and others using both WPF and Android applications. Once the data is captured, we    will store these real-time results in MongoDB and provide a simple web service secured    with Windows Identity Foundation (WIF) to access and submit data securely from mobile    devices. Providing efficient, integrated services such as these will be increasingly    important in providing the best data and analysis possible to both healthcare providers    and consumers.</p>",

JavaScript has    moved far beyond tricks like manipulating an HTML DOM and is being used to build    powerful client-side (and server-side) libraries. As these libraries become more    complex, inheritance can play a major role in how these libraries are implemented,    consumed, and customized. With JavaScript's dynamic nature there is more than one    approach you can take to achieve inheritance. Some of these approaches have performance    implications, while others are more a matter of taste and style. In this session    we'll discuss these approaches and which ones are best for different scenarios.</p>",

I have. Come find out    what I've been learning about how to achieve some harmony in the design of an enterprise    system. Find out how the lessons of OOP, SOA, EDA, DDD, CQRS, and other buzzwords    can be distilled into a core set of first principles. Using these ideas I hope to    share how to begin thinking about architecture instead of learning how to copy architecture.    I'll be demonstrating this thinking in practice by walking you through the design    of an online ordering system, and I'll leave you with the resources you need to    continue your journey.</p>",

This approach usually cost    more in bandwidth than we wanted it to. SignalR simplifies this process, and makes    it more useful for the ASP.NET developer.

      "Abstract": "<p>    If you are going to code camp, you likely know how valuable programming skills are,    and perhaps you one day want your kids to learn these skills too. Programming teaches    kids many valuable lessons: how to think logically and rationally, how to plan ahead,    how to problem solve, and how to swear properly. But how do we teach kids to program    today? When we were kids we were ecstatic to see a green blinking cursor on the    screen prompting us to type our name so we could have the program print it repeatedly    on the page while(true). How do we get today’s kids with XBoxes and Nintendos interested    in rudimentary programming of “if” statements? In this session Tommy Davis (age    9) and his dad Scott will discuss four programming languages and how they work for    kids: Scratch, Lego Mindstorms, Python, and C#. We will demonstrate each language    and talk about Tom’s experience in each, what worked well and what didn’t, and what    approaches you might take to get your own kids into programming. Tommy attended    his first Twin Cities Code Camp last fall, where he showed off the Windows Phone    game he had made before coming to the conference as the youngest programmer in attendance.</p>",

It seems counter-intuitive    - the idea that the best path forward when embarking on new product development    should focus on the smallest possible product. Why not go big and try to launch    with a big splash? Won't your customers be turned off by a lack of features and    glorious complexity? As it turns out, taking the path of humility towards your market    is a far more productive path. You can start with a small hypothesis - test that    hypothesis against real customers. Using continuous delivery, you can rapidly iterating    over your product, using data, rather than opinion, to guide your product development    efforts. Such an approach not only costs less money, it allows you to vet the initiative    before it becomes \"too big to fail\". In this session, we will cover what the MVP    is, how you define one, and how you use validated learning to guide your efforts.    Further, we will cover how agile software development and continuous delivery are    essential to product development efforts that use this approach.</p>",

More advanced concepts, like continuous delivery and lean enterprise, can't exist without agile and modern engineering practices. If you run a business, and are not using concepts like product over project, funding following results, and ubiquitous visible metrics, it's only a matter of time before you are disrupted by Amazon or Google.\n\nIn this talk, we will explore the connection between code quality and these higher order concerns that differentiate the disruptors from the disrupted in the 21st century.",

In short: near native speeds, using C and C++, inside of the browser.  Even better, emscripten converts OpenGL, a desktop graphics API, into WebGL, which is the web variant of that API.\u000b\u000bThis talk is applicable to not only web developers, but native coders, too.

      "Abstract": "Have you ever been at the grocery store trying to decide what to buy for dinner? Well you are in luck! No more wandering around the market wondering what you should buy for your next meal, when you can build a bot that can pick your dinner for you! In this session we will dive into the Microsoft Bot Framework; where you will learn the basics of building a simple chat bot in C#, how to publish it on the proper bot platform and how to upgrade its natural language processing using LUIS (Language Understanding Intelligent Service). After leaving this session, you will have all the resources you need to build your very own FridgeBot. Your FridgeBot will be a handy chat bot that will help you find a recipe based on the available ingredients you already have! All you will have to do is tell it you are hungry, give it a list of ingredients you have at home and it will recommend a dish containing those ingredients!",

      "Title": "A developer's guide to data binding in XAML applications",
      "Abstract": "Few technologies have proven themselves to be as productive as declarative XAML. But why is it so productive and why do developers love it so much? Data binding is a big reason. Almost every other platform has tried to copy it. Data binding is an art, a science, and a powerful asset in your toolbox. Let's learn what so many developers already know: how it works, what you can do, and a peek into where data binding is evolving as Microsoft continues to innovate and invest in this amazing UX platform feature.",

Not only can Docker-izing your .NET development environment solves that issue, but it can make it drop-dead simple to onboard new developers, keep a team working forward and allow everyone on the team use their desired tools! \nI will show you how to get Docker set up to use as the run environment for your .NET projects, how to maintain the docker environment, and even how easy it will be to deploy the whole environment to production in a way that you are actually developing in an environment that isn’t just “like” production. It IS the production environment!\nYou will learn the basics of Docker, how to use it to develop and how to deploy your “development” environment as the production environment!",

      "Abstract": "Nothing improves a team like trust.  Teams which trust one another can conquer more problems, more quickly, because less time is lost to friction.  Teams which are trusted by the business are capable of creating substantial change within their organizations.  In short: Trust Changes Everything.  But how do we create trust?  We all know that just putting a group of people together does not mean they will trust one another.  Some will say it comes with time, but it certainly isn't guaranteed to come with time.  But there are ways that teams can be deliberate about creating trust.  There are skills which they can learn and practice which will engender trust, not from manipulation but from vulnerability.  Your teams can be much more successful, and your life on them more fun and engaging, if you help them develop trust first, and software second.",

Mixed Reality provides an immersive UXD experience that is unrivaled.\n\nThis talk will use the HoloLens and Unity 3D to give a crash course in AR/MR concepts, how an MR application is put together and some of the UX and design considerations. This includes:\n\n• Real World Understanding (Spatial Mapping, Spatial Understanding)\n• Holograms (Billboarding, Placement, Physics)\n• Control (Gaze, Cursor, Gestures, Speech)\n\nYou’ll leave with an understanding of HoloLens terminology and techniques, by watching a real HoloLens app get built step-by-step using each of these AR concepts.",

      "Abstract": "CRUD apps destroy data.\n\nDelete is an obviously destructive operation, but Update is no better. Updates overwrite the data that was once present. What would software look like if the only valid operations were Create and Read?\n\nHistorical Modeling is a technique for designing and building software systems that permit only inserts, no updates, no deletes. The only way to \"modify\" an object is to insert related records. You can then read the state of the object by querying for the presence or absence of those related records. We'll start with the assumption that all records are immutable and indelible. From there, we'll build a set of patterns that yield some surprising benefits.\n\nWith a historical model, synchronizing disparate nodes is trivial: just insert what you don't yet have. Building offline-first web applications is easy. Viewing a snapshot of the system at any point in the past is a simple query.\n\nLet's build a historical model together, and see these benefits for ourselves. Let's put aside the assumptions of CRUD applications and discover a whole new set of patterns. Once you master these techniques, you will never destroy data again.",

Making sense of it all can be a nightmare!\nWhat if you could put those days permanently behind you? What if all your UI components always had access to the state they needed? What if they were auto-magically updated and re-rendered when that state changed?  This is the promise of modern state management in frontend frameworks. Starting with the flux architecture, a proliferation of technologies and tools has emerged to help you keep track of it all.\n\nThis talk will explain the state management problem and show examples of how it is solved with Vue.js and Vuex. If those particulars are not your cup of tea, links will be provided to similar tools on all the modern frameworks.  Stop struggling with state. Learn how to keep track of it all!",

If all you need is to see the requests made between the browser and web server, the browser devtools can do that.  Fiddler has many more advanced features that most developers are unaware of.   It can be used to capture traffic from smartphones, tablets, and non-Windows platforms!  Discover the power of manipulating requests and responses with breakpoints, the auto responder, and a visual composer.  Review popular extensions for formatting JavaScript, syntax highlighting, and detecting image bloat.

Is :focus given that much thought since browser's style these by default? Often, focus outlines are turned off in CSS to meet non-inclusive design standards, but this causes problems for keyboard users. How can we make the web a more inclusive place while maintaining design intent?.\n\nAs we build more and more things on the web, we must do our part in building awesome, accessible user experiences. Except native default browser styling of the :focus pseudo class is rather blah, don't you think? There has to be a better way to add some pizzazz to elements when users navigate without a mouse. In this talk, I will demo numerous ways to provide custom focus styles despite known limitations in the web platform. For users with disabilities, it's imperative that visual design finds a way to meet in the middle.",

These are all qualifying cases of poor vision, but low vision is more complicated than the prescription of glasses or contacts.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, they categorize low vision based on specific levels of visual acuity and field of vision (W3.org, 2016). With that in mind, we as developers can look at different categories of low vision including color vision, visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, etc and make an effort to bake in things like zoom, non-conflicting colors, and re-wrapping of columns in to our code.\n\nMy talk will cover what vision accessibility is, different categories of low vision, what the needs of the users are, and what we as developers can do to achieve a great user experience for low vision users.",

In this session we'll cover the basics of ARM templates with some basic demonstrations and explore the use cases in which you'd want to use them, and also the use cases when they won't add much value. We'll explore strategies for managing your own ARM template repositories and how to incorporate them into a continuous delivery pipeline.",

Before debating React vs. Angular or .NET vs Node, we must ask ourselves, should we even build this? Whether you’re an entrepreneur launching a new project, an enterprise developer stuck integrating middleware, or a architect moving logic to the cloud, you’re making decisions that will have lasting consequences. Deciding which problems are worth your investment is at the root of success or failure.\n\nJoin us as we dig into real case studies from enterprises and startups. We’ll explore the options, costs, and risks inherent in deciding what to build, what to buy, and alternatives in between. We’ll consider the opportunity cost of building systems, the sustainability of open-source, and the risks of vendor lock-in. You’ll leave equipped to make better decisions in your daily development and solve the problems that matter.",

      "Abstract": "I've been building applications for a long time, but I've never been \"the build guy\". Until recently, I've managed to avoid setuping automatic build and deployment pipelines. That being said, it's an important skill to have on your project team. The ability to get code off of your box and into production quickly is essential for developing agile software. The faster you can deploy, the more quickly you can adapt to change. Deploys should be like voting, done both early and often.\n\nOver the past few months, I've gotten the chance to learn this important skill. This talk is for anyone who's new to building their own deployment pipelines. In this talk, you'll learn how to build and deploy an ASP.NET Core application using Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS). We'll begin with an application and work through the various choices in the process of getting from a repository of code to a deployed application in production. After this talk, you'll be able to build your own CI/CD Pipelines.",

      "Abstract": "APIs are a way of life for modern web developers. APIs based around access to individual resources, also known as RESTful APIs, have been the default for years. While REST has served us well, there are situations where REST isn't the best. Sometimes your data model isn't easily described as a few simple resources. Sometimes you don't want to bring back everything from the server. For those situations, we have a new way of accessing data, GraphQL.\n\nGraphQL is a query language for your API. Created by Facebook in 2015 to speed up their mobile application, GraphQL has seen rapid adoption by companies including GitHub, Twitter, and Intuit. GraphQL simplifies requests by having the client define what data they want from the server. A single API endpoint can supply just what the client needs.\n\nIn this talk, you will learn about GraphQL and how it can make your APIs cleaner. You'll see how GraphQL compares to REST and when you would want to use each approach. You'll learn how to build a GraphQL API and a client application that uses it. After this talk, you'll be able use GraphQL to simplify your own APIs.",

      "Abstract": "Are you encountering problems which require dissemination of small-mid size datasets? Do you need to distribute this data across multiple regions on different clouds or on premises? Probably you are sending this data to a NoSQL data store and querying it in runtime or distributing JSON/XML files across all your servers to accomplish this. Netflix Hollow is a java library and toolset for disseminating in-memory datasets from a single producer to many consumers for high performance read-only access. In this talk I will show how Hollow can help you to distribute datasets on different environments using blob storages for KB, MB or few GB of data, optimizing the performance of your applications and achieving extreme stability and reliability by showcasing different aspects of Hollow and potential use cases for it in your projects",

A critical customer has relayed their deep dissatisfaction and they want their problem addressed now… or else.\n\nAfterwards, we often focus our energy on preventing emergencies like these in the future.  However, what if you and your organization put a fraction of those efforts towards preparing for the next time the alarm goes off?  Simple changes in how you and your organization react will pay big dividends.  Your company can get back to business as usual sooner.  Your customers can get quick satisfaction.  Most importantly, you and your colleagues can retain your sanity.\n\nThis talk will examine high pressure situations commonly faced in software delivery to identify simple improvements that can be made.  Whether you are an engineer or CIO, you have the power to make enhancements to behaviors and processes that will result in happier customers and less stressed employees.",

      "Abstract": "With Google Apps Script, Google has provided a way for developers to add functional to Google Suite apps. While using Google's in-browser editor to write sample Google Add-ons can be handy for extremely basic scripts, it gets clunky fast when developers want to do something like version control their code or have more than one person working on a script. With the help of a couple open source projects, developers can now build Add-ons on locally, on their own machines, with the tools they're most comfortable with.",

      "Abstract": "Component libraries, design systems, style guides, and pattern libraries: more buzzwords and best practices that you can’t stop hearing about. \n\nPerhaps your dev team could really benefit from a reusable component library or your designers need some encouragement to keep consistent within their mockups. Maybe your team already has a handful of patterns scattered throughout various CSS projects and you’re hoping to find a better way to maintain it all.  Sounds like a win, right? The spirit of the idea is great, but like most best practices, a practical implementation is time consuming and challenging.\n\nIn this talk, we’ll dive into a practical approach for creating a component library. We’ll chat about the complete project from design processes to technical infrastructure decisions to quality standards and how a component will actually show up on your user’s device. Come get a practical guide to answering the right questions, prioritizing the appropriate requirements, and get on your way starting your own library!",

In the real world, teams are formed by circumstance, schedule, and availability.    As a result,  behavioral dynamics on a team can impair its ability to be productive and efficient.   \n\nThis session surfaces the most common sources of individual behavioral differences and challenges.   The objective is not to offer tips to change people, but rather, to learn to overcome those differences.    Concrete tips and techniques will be provided that participants can take back to apply on their own teams.\n\nLearning Outcomes:\n\n\t• Behavior Measurement\n\t\t○ Overview and comparison of popular behavior and personality measurement tools including DISC, MBTI, Strength Finders and Spiral Dynamics\n\t\t○ Risks to avoid when  \"measuring\" and labeling people\n\t\t○ Measuring, calibrating, and monitoring individual and team behavior\n\t\t○ Tips and techniques  to incorporate and use these measures effectively on project teams\n\t\t○ NOTE: Participants will be provide a free DISC assessment worksheet to complete on their own and use with their teams.\n\t• Conflict\n\t\t○ Recognize and understand common sources of conflict\n\t\t○ Discerning good conflict from bad conflict\n\t\t○ How to measure team concordance/discordance\n\t\t○ Tips and techniques for transforming conflict into effective decisions\n\t• Change Aversion\n\t\t○ Understand why change is hard for some, easy for others\n\t\t○ Recognizing good change from destructive change\n\t\t○ Change management by role \n\t\t\t§ Product Owner\n\t\t\t§ Scrum Master \n\t\t\t§ Development Team Member\n\t\t\t§ Stakeholder\n\t• The Agile Introvert\n\t\t○ Agile practices that intrude on  an introvert's natural tendencies\n\t\t○ Understand behavioral and motivational differences between introvers and extroverts\n\t\t○ Examples of team working agreements to accommodate needs of introverts and extroverts\n\t• Additional brain stuff that's useful to know\n\t\t○ How to avoid building the wrong thing due to false memories\n\t\t○ Making better commitments by overcoming Dunning Kruger, Illusory Superiority, and replacement ignorance phenomena\n\t\t○ Understand why  procrastination occurs, and how to overcome it\n\t\t○ Additional behavioral anti-patterns",

      "Abstract": "When accessing a typical RESTful API, you get whatever data the API you're calling deems appropriate. You will probably receive a lot of data you don't need and if you need different types of data you may have to call multiple endpoints. Released publicly by FaceBook in 2015, GraphQL helps to lessen the pain of interacting with APIs by allowing clients to query exactly the data they need--nothing more, nothing less. \n\nIn this session, we will learn how to use GraphQL  by accessing some well-known APIs (like Reddit and GitHub). We will also briefly discuss how you can build your own GraphQL-based API in .NET.",

This is an easy-to-add, lightweight tool for processing background work and allowing for us to integrate processes that would have needed a background service in the past. Hangfire is free and has a paid upgrade version available for additional functionality. It's also easy to add to your projects via nuget.\n\nThe second tool we'll look at is Elmah for error logging. This tool is available for free as a nuget package, and can be easily wired up to log your errors, as well as other critical application information at the time of the error.\n\nThe final tool we'll look at is Stackify Prefix, which is a great tool for looking into your web requests, and can specifically help you recognize instances where you might be overworking your web and database resources.\n\nAll of the tools are good for any .Net application, however in this talk we'll be using a default ASP.Net MVC classic application for the purposes of our demonstration. All tools also work with .Net core applications.",

      "Abstract": "In this session, we'll go from the ground up to a fully functional .Net Core Web application using Angular on the front-end. This is accomplished with a free framework: ASP.Net Boilerplate.\n\nWe'll start by getting a project up and running, which does have a few tricks. Once we're up and running, we'll be able to move very quickly through some of the key points of the layered architecture.\n\nWe'll build a model and create the code-first migration to set the database using Entity Framework Core. We'll then build an application service that leverages dependency injection to work against our data. We'll Swagger our service so that the front-end can leverage the automatically generated service proxies.\n\nOur UI layer will leverage Angular and will be fully built in typescript with less and html. With a few notes about some wiring most of the \"hard\" work of angular is handled for us, and we can concentrate on coding our systems.\n\nAuthentication and permissions are a breeze, as are managing roles and user permissions, making setup for multi-tenancy with various user roles fairly painless. This is accomplished through an admin user that can manage users and roles, and also by locking down various methods in our service with code.\n\nThe guys at Volosoft have thought of mostly everything - even setting up a built-in multi-lingual architecture. Furthermore, if you need a more powerful solution that has built in masquerading, a full version of the product is available for purchase at ASP.Net Zero.",

Things like non-CRUD operations, response validation, error handling, in-memory state management etc. just get really hard. This talk covers how GraphQL - a standard that unifies server and client communication - comes to save the day, and why the tooling around it is a game-changer.\n\nWe will answer the following questions. What is the philosophy behind GraphQL? How do you architect a scalable schema? How can GraphQL boost productivity? How can you avoid common pitfalls?\n\nWe will then get a GraphQL server up and running together while focusing on exploring real-world patterns for architecting our schema. We will discuss and implement practical steps to improve query performance, error handling and caching. By the end of this talk, you will leave with a working GraphQL server while we explore real-world patterns.",

While the single-threaded model added to developer comfort, it also made the platform unable to do serious and time-consuming calculations, and the only way to circumvent it was to do it on a remote server.\n\nLuckily, with the introduction and widespread adoption of Web Workers, we can now do resource-intensive calculations on background threads. A Web Worker allows you to run JavaScript in the background, without affecting the performance of the page. Even if you are running really resource intense code in the browser, you can continue to do whatever you want: clicking, selecting things, etc., while the Web Worker runs in the background.\n\nIn this talk, we will explore:\n\nWeb Workers, how and when you can use them, and their peculiarities.\nPerf and framerate benefits (with data!)\nPolyfilling for naughty browsers\nFuture: WebGL, Canvas2D, and other marvels browser vendors are cooking up.",

But what if you don't know what problems to solve? Or what if you answer a problem that doesn't really exist? UX can help align your machine learning efforts with your users, creating human-centered machine learning with results that are actionable and relevant to your user base.",

It can be used to capture traffic from smartphones, tablets, and non-Windows platforms!  Discover the power of manipulating requests and responses with breakpoints, the auto responder, and a visual composer.  Review popular extensions for formatting JavaScript, syntax highlighting, and detecting image bloat.

Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.  The combination of Azure Kubernetes Service and Azure Container Registry brings a nicely packaged solution that is easy to use and fast to deploy.\n\nThis talk will dig into how to use AKS and ACR to orchestrate the deployment of docker containers, and how to scale that deployment once it is in place. Most of this talk will be hands on using the tools. The topics covered include:\n\n• What is Kubernetes? What is Azure Kuburnetes Service?  What is the Azure Container Registry?\n• Review an example and how the containers were registered in ACS.\n• Review the deployment in AKS from ACS\n• Demonstrate scaling the deployment in AKS\n\nYou'll leave with an understanding of how to deploy Kubernetes and Docker in Azure and an understanding of why I believe this is the platform you should be targeting in Azure today.\n\nTARGET AUDIENCE: Developers, Architects, Technical Leaders",

Yeah, it has kind of a pretentious tagline \"The PHP Framework For Web Artisans\", but it is REALLY cool.\n\nIt has everything: routing, models, database migrations, middleware, authentication, tons of helper functions, an ORM called Eloquent that is really rad, sane defaults, Laravel Mix (really nice for compiling sass/css and js components), workers, queues, this thing where you can send actual hand written mail from it if you want, and it has a terrific community!\n\nRight now Laravel is really gaining steam, and it feels like there's actual magic happening with the amount of goodwill and positivity that exists in this ecosystem. If you want to be part of something  special, you'll really want to check this out!",

      "Abstract": "Many teams are trying to peel parts of their monolithic applications into smaller chunks that can stand on their own and even be deployed independently of other applications (microservices, anyone??).  This talk will describe the benefit that creating starters, templates, and packages can have on teams doing this kind of work -- or even simply starting more than one new application.  The concrete examples will be shown using .NET Core, but these concepts can apply to any language and team that is trying to break down  monoliths.  Packages and templates can encapsulate your opinions and make them sharable and updatable much better than saying \"copy / paste these pieces from another project\".  Demonstrated in this talk will be an ASP.NET Core Web API template that includes bearer token authentication, error handling / logging, and Swagger, as well as an ASP.NET Core Web MVC project that includes standard npm packages, OpenId/OAuth2 setup for authentication, and logging.  We'll spend most of our time looking at the mechanics of the templates - the templates themselves, publishing as Nuget packages, and using the CLI to instantiate projects.",

Have you heard of principles like loose coupling and programming to an abstraction, but didn’t know if you were really doing it right?  If so, this talk is for you.  \n\nIn this talk, I’ll work from several example code segments and show how to recognize which design pattern would be appropriate.  I’ll then show how to refactor the existing code to use the chosen design pattern and demonstrate how the resulting code is more understandable, easier to maintain and easier to test.\n\nAmong the examples I will show is how a dependency on an external system can be refactored using an interface and applying the bridge and adaptor pattern. I’ll also show how to use the decorator pattern to cache results from an external call.  Finally, I’ll show examples of how patterns like the strategy pattern and chain of responsibility pattern can replace large blocks of if/else if statements to create a simpler design that is easier to test.\n\nWhen this talk is complete, you will have a good idea of how to recognize where these patterns can be applied in your codebase and how you go about implementing them.",

The problem: no one cared.\n\nA brilliant project isn't enough. I had to spread my vision, which was difficult for a developer like me. I learned quickly that even the best ideas needed to be sold. I had to build an audience, tell a story, and win over customers. Join me for a developer's guide to marketing.

Angular, React, Vue, ShinyNewFramework.js... doesn't matter. You can build a single set of components and use them accross all of your sites. Because they are native browser constructs, applications built with web components also render quickly.\n\nIn this talk, you will learn about the web components standard and how to use them in your application. You'll learn about the why web components are useful, some libraries that can help you build them, and how to integrate them in your own applications. By the end of this talk, you'll be ready to build your own suite of web components.",

It can also be challenging for the mentee to work with someone peering over their shoulder, seeing their every mistake.\n\nThis session will go over some of the things that happen unintentionally while mentoring through pair programming and how they can negatively affect the learner, the learning process, and the relationship itself. More importantly, it’ll talk about what a mentor can do to improve the success of the learner by making adjustments to how they teach.",

We will walk through my approach to integrating Machine Learning into a team. The topics covered include:\n\n• Where to start, while minimizing investment and risk.\n• The spectrum of tools from off the shelf to handcrafted. \n• Packaging and deploying your model.\n• Integrating your model into your system.\n• Other considerations and risks.\n\nYou'll leave with my perspective on how to introduce a team to machine learning and how I recommend integrating machine learning into your software development toolkit.\n\nTARGET AUDIENCE: Senior Developers, Architects, Technical Leaders",

And you haven’t even started on security considerations yet. During this presentation, the attendees will be introduced to OpenID Connect and OAuth. They will also learn how to leverage these technologies to create more secure applications. Most importantly, they will learn how to delegate authorization and authentication so they can focus on their real work and forget about all that security stuff.",

The tools of yesterday brought us to where we are, but the relational engine is not your only choice. In this session we look at storage options, including Relational, NoSQL and Document databases including SQL Azure, MySQL, Cosmos DB and Azure Storage, and show pros and cons of each. We walk thru converting a real application from using SQL Server to using storage options in the cloud, including SQL Database, table storage and Cosmos DB. We see how to leverage storage patterns to make the most out of our investment in the cloud.",

In this session, an “enterprise” developer turned business founder shares stories of past failed projects, and how better testing could have prevented it.

This is accomplished with a free framework: ASP.Net Boilerplate.\n\nWe'll start by getting a project up and running, which does have a few tricks. Once we're up and running, we'll be able to move very quickly through some of the key points of the layered architecture.\n\nWe'll build a model and create the code-first migration to set the database using Entity Framework Core. We'll then build an application service that leverages dependency injection to work against our data. We'll Swagger our service so that the front-end can leverage the automatically generated service proxies.\n\nOur UI layer will leverage Angular and will be fully built in typescript with less and html. With a few notes about some wiring most of the \"hard\" work of angular is handled for us, and we can concentrate on coding our systems.\n\nAuthentication and permissions are a breeze, as are managing roles and user permissions, making setup for multi-tenancy with various user roles fairly painless. This is accomplished through an admin user that can manage users and roles, and also by locking down various methods in our service with code.\n\nThe guys at Volosoft have thought of mostly everything - even setting up a built-in multi-lingual architecture. Furthermore, if you need a more powerful solution that has built in masquerading, a full version of the product is available for purchase at ASP.Net Zero.",

However, falling years behind is a completely different story, and can feel like an insurmountable challenge to overcome knowing you can't put your business on hold. In this presentation, Mike will cover cultural and technological issues that can hold a system/team/company behind. He will present ideas on how you can start incrementally adopting modern and healthy practices such as DevOps, automated testing, and upgrading to newer platforms. This is a safe space where we don't need to feel ashamed, and Mike will use scenarios from an inherited ASP.NET WebForms system with no automated tests, time-consuming manual deployments, an out of control error log, and a shortage of developers willing to work on such a system.",

      "Abstract": "In a healthy engineering culture, everyone is a part of the release process, but that’s not always the case for builds. Sometimes the developers own it. Sometimes the ops team owns it. In many organizations, no one owns it. Because of this, engineers have grown complacent with inefficient builds and even joke about how bad build times are. But it doesn't have to be that way. Now that she works for a company that focuses on build automation, Jenn realizes that many of the habits she developed as a software engineer are incredibly inefficient and can be improved with Developer Productivity Engineering.\n\nJoin in to learn these tool-agnostic steps to achieve build happiness:\n* Measure your builds.\n* Analyze the data to see how developers and CI systems are running builds.\n* Optimize build script logic and the processes to run them.\n* Iterate to maintain build builds and happy engineers.",

In this session, we're going to push Blazor to the limit and do demos with Blazor running not just on web, but mobile, and desktop as well.  We'll see how Blazor can hold up to typical software requirements such as validation, authorization, server pre-rendering, and much more.  If you're remotely interested in Blazor, you won't want to miss these demos.",

Solutions such as IHostedServices, BackgroundServices, Worker Services, Hangfire, and more.

In this talk, you will learn how GraphQL - a standard that unifies server and client communication - comes to save the day, and why the tooling around it is a game-changer.\nWe will answer the following questions. What is the philosophy behind GraphQL? How do you architect a scalable schema? How can GraphQL boost productivity? How can you avoid common pitfalls?\n\nWe will then get a GraphQL server up and running while focusing on exploring real-world patterns for architecting our schema. We will discuss and implement practical steps to improve query performance, error handling and caching.",

Basically, App Configuration offers a central place to manage app settings, environment variables, config values, and secrets. The feature also allows updating these configurations at runtime without needing to restart or redeploy an app service.\n\nImagine these two items being used in conjunction to create a solution where automation rules, deployment risk is reduced, and new features can be introduced into your application very rapidly, but more importantly very safely. It would be like if the New England Patriots wanted to try out a new offense against the lowly Detroit Lions for one week, while not worrying about de-railing their annual trip to the Super Bowl.",

Using Ruby, these simple \"run only as needed functions\" will allow you to maintain a highly available and cost affordable API because you will no longer need to maintain servers to keep your APIs available. You can rely on AWS (or maybe another cloud provider) to do that heavy lifting for you. Get an introduction with a demo on just how easy it is to get a simple API up & running, persisting data to a database, and adding a basic authorizer.\n\nhttps://slides.com/danitornow/serverless-framework#/\nhttps://github.com/danitornow/serverless",

We will start with an example showing the amazing performance gains that can be had using Async / Await. Then discuss Task Based Asynchronous Processing and the under-the-covers mechanisms ExecutionContext and SynchronizationContext to understand their role.

We will explore the differences between these three options, as well as look at some concrete demos of each and see how they behave in practice.
